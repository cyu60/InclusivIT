# InclusivIT

InclusivIT is a web application designed to ensure that all language used in your content is inclusive and respectful. This is accomplished by using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to scan for potentially offensive or insensitive terms and phrases, check pronoun usage, identify stereotyping, spot exclusive language, and detect microaggressions.

InclusivIT provides a real-time analysis of your text, providing suggestions and feedback to promote inclusive language usage.
